# AVR-wastepin
Just a repository of sample AVR code in C, Cpp and Assembler

This will be nothing nifty - so dont get your head too big on this!

PS: Yes GuruMeditation is a reference to all those many, many GuruMeditation screens I had back in the days of Amiga (A500) C-programming.
All those un-initialized pointers for the AmigaLib-Calls, still get my head spinning.. 
"What was that ? Was it an airplaine, .. a pointer, a reference or just a big, nifty ZERO!??"

Want a peek on the Amiga-style?

Ah peek and poke .. the good old C64 code.. another memory flashes past!

And No .. I don't dread those days .. They are the simply "good old times" in retrospect of vanilla clouds everyone keeps musing about. 
That's what the dinosaurs said! :-)
